# FinTech Case Study

### **Overview and Origin**

 Conceived in 2004 to create a monetary system that was decentralized and to empower individuals to create their own money. Ripple is a for-profit technology platform and also a cryptocurrency (XRP). The company provides real-time payment settlements and currency exchange services to financial institutions such as banks and payment processors.

Ryan Fugger and later joined by Jared McCaleb  and Chris Larsen  

### **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
  The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks.  ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*8gG2DMHmnGJBIyDtR79rjA.png)

### **How much funding have they received?**
 Ripple is funded through institutional investors and venture capital Their revenue model is based on professional services and creating integration to the RipleNet for financial institutions. 
 ### **How is the company funded?** 
They have closed about five rounds of funding which included: two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one series A round, one Series B round and one Series C round totalling around 300 million dollars.  

## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
Most financial institutions are still using technologies developed in the 70’s to resolve payments. For cross-border transactions, banks and payment processors charge high fees and take days to process payments. Ripple’s ultimate goal is making money move with the same ease and speed that information does in the digital age, meaning low-fee instantaneous payments in currencies that people actually use in their daily lives. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?**  
At this point, Ripple is the most accomplished when it comes to forming partnerships and breaking into the existing business world, the primarily target market is B2B. The financial institutions that make up the RippleNet include a diverse set of entities, including Central Banks, Private Banks, remittance firms, brokerage and payments providers. 
 

### **Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
According to McKinsey, Global payments ballooned to $1.9 Trillion in 2017 and are forecast to grow to $ 2 trillion by 2020.

### **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
One of the main competitive advantages of ripple is its transaction settlement rate. Which is the amount of time it takes a merchant to receive funds from a customer for a transaction. Another advantage of Ripple versus its peers is that it is actually being used by over 100 companies.

### **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** 
Ripple uses at least 15 applications such as JQuery, JavaScript, Nginx, Reach, Java, Html5, PostgreSQL, Google Drive, ES6, TypeScript, Redis, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. As well as blockchain technology.  Ripple uses its technology to secure a network of validating servers with an internal ledger that guarantees transactions based on consensus. Instead of mining rewards, all 100 billion Ripple coins are pre-mined and Ripple Labs control the dispersion of new coins.




## Landscape:

### **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.

### **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
One of the latest trends in the industry is that Federated Blockchain will move to the center stage. It is merely an upgraded form of the basic blockchain model, which makes it more ideal for many specific use cases. In this type of Blockchain, instead of one organization, multiple authorities can control the pre-selected nodes of Blockchain. In turn, this selected group of various nodes will validate the block so that the transactions can be processed further. Another trend that is coming is that the economy and finance will lead Blockchian applications. After it was successfully applied for cryptocurrency, financial institutions began seriously considering blockchain adoption for traditional banking operations. According to a PWC report from 2017, [77% of financial institutions are expected to adopt blockchain technology as part of an in-production system or process by 2020.](https://www.pwc.com/jg/en/publications/pwc-global-fintech-report-17.3.17-final.pdf) 
Moreover, one more movement that we will begin to see is the Blockchain integration into government agencies. The idea of the distributed ledger is also very attractive to government authorities that have to administrate very large quantities of data. According to Gartner, by 2022, more than a [billion people will have some data about them stored on a blockchain.](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-a-virtual-world-of-exponential-change/) A couple of other trends that we can point out just to name a few: Blockchain combines with IOT, Blockchain with AI, Rising demand for Blockchain experts.

### **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
Among other blockchain companies are Coinbase, ScienceSoft, Prolifics, Blockchangers, Limechain, Intellectsoft, IBM, Circle, Steem, Voatz.
In terms of cryptocurrencies companies with have Bitcoin, Gemini, Ethereum, Litecoin, Coinbase, LedgerX, Stellar


## Results

### **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
Ripple will end up replacing [Swift.](https://www.swift.com/) 
The society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), for the past 50 years and the likes of Visa and Mastercard have been dominating the payment network. Blockchain systems run on the premise of replacing the legacy systems with a more secure and efficient payment infrastructure. Forcing the mainstream players to face the evolutionary puzzle of “adapt or die”. Ripple says it was signing up an average two customers per week in 2018 as it is attempting to break into the legacy software and network business that hasn’t changed much for over four decades. Ripple’s success has forced companies like Visa to adapt fast. Earlier this year Visa announced the acquisition of Paid, a financial services company that builds a data transfer network that powers Fintech and digital finance products.

### **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
Transparency, one of the key selling points of the blockchain industry is the distributed ledger recording every on-chain transaction in an immutable way. True decentralization, led by companies like ethereum network taking advantage of the Smart Contracts technology revealed itself to be a great tool to measure success of a company. This transparency allowed websites such dapp.com to fetch data for each decentralized application and showcase the actual usage of an application. It means that the community has the power to follow and support companies based not only on their marketing power but on their actual gain of market shares in the decentralized world. 
To make the blockchain implementation truly transformative, projects should begin with the business objectives and apply blockchain technology when they can capitalize on its key characteristics. A decentralized, immutable trust model keeps all players honest. Alignment between technology outcomes and business goals is a key factor in blockchain projects success. Start with business objectives, which should be specific, measurable, agree-upon, realistic and time-based (smart). Because Smart business goals have measurable objectives, executives can use them to create key performance indicators (KPIs). They can use these to measure the performance of blockchain based business systems. 
Some people believe that the following items are missing from blockchain performance reports:
* Stress Tests
* Randomized transactions
* Standard Ratios
* Minimum Requirements
* Steady state behavior 
* Costs

However successful, there is some controversy about Ripple’s business model. According to a [report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2019/03/01/is-ripple-a-scam/#1ccda9ef79a4)
 from Jason Bloomberg former Enterprise and Cloud reporter for Forbes, he states that the company’s business model is a scam. He says “*At its core, the Ripple business model is a pump and dump scheme, as it undergoes numerous activities to increase the value of the XRP cryptocurrency. Unlike most crypto pump and dumps, however, Ripple takes numerous steps to obscure this basic fact.*”

### **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
At this point, it is well known that Ripple is the most accomplished when it comes to forming partnerships and breaking into the existing business world. The sheer quantity and quality of the partnerships is staggering, considerably outshining anything that other projects have established. There is a certain unmatched recognition that Ripple possesses and a certain amount of that must undeniably come from a veritable utility of Ripple’s banking solutions. In other words, it wouldn’t have attracted these players if it weren’t actually good. The company’s executives have also been lobbying some insiders in the financial industry, like Christine Lagarde the chairman of the ECB. The slew of successful pilot programs and the general warming of the sentiment towards Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) bodes well for Ripple and XRP(Ripple’s digital coin) which holds an iron grip on this niche of the market. 

## Recommendations

### **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**
It is known that Ripple has issues with the perception of its XRP(digital coin). The company put the majority of its stake in 55 billion XRP in a cryptographically- secured escrow account, and sells a little bit of that every month. While some argue that the company as a stand-alone software business is good, others believe that the Ripple-XRP relationship is basically two sides of the same coin. So the question becomes if XRP is necessary in the Ripple ecosystem. Instead of XRP I would recommend a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called [stable coins.](https://blockchain.news/analysis/why-stablecoins-are-securing-the-future-of-crypto-world#:~:text=Stablecoins%20are%20designed%20to%20maintain,common%20in%20the%20cryptocurrency%20markets.&text=Most%20crypto%20traders%20and%20investors%20are%20increasingly%20seeking%20stablecoins.) 

### **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Stablecoins such as Paxos(PAX), Tether(USDT), USD Coin (USDC) have all retained their market capitalization, that is they are trading at the value of their deposited assets. Looking at the performance over March, the story remains the same amid the backdrop of one of the worst months in crypto’s history. While most of the crypto market has been down since March, the industry top 5 stable coins have barrely shifted in value over a much larger time frame. Traditional assets have been taking a hit and major cryptos such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) have experienced huge bouts of volatility and declines in value but stablecoins are looking more like a safe haven for those who want to remain in the market without exposing themselves to too much risk.

### **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
Stable coins also use Blockchain, the open sourced digital ledgers that many have argued will do everything from make cash obsolete to remake the global economy. While it has found a place in niches such as supply chains and digital IDs, problems like price volatility and the need to comply with the existing regulatory framework have prevented mainstream adoption in currency. But now stablecoins seems poised to succeed where its predecessors failed. One example of a new stablecoin that has been adopted by several online merchants across Southeast Asia called Terra, it employs a form of automated monetary policy to keep its price stable, contracting the supply when prices are too low and expanding it when prices are too high. This is achieved using a second cryptocurrency called Luna, which acts as a monetary policy instrument and earns transaction fees as a form of reward.Terra’s policy is coded directly on its blockchain and therefore is transparent and impervious to human interference. 

### **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
These technologies are far less controversial that the current system Ripple uses to hold XRP. It is open sourced, transparent and very important because they harness the potential of blockchain in a form that’s useful for everyday people.
